            <p class="lead">
                IIC’s innovative real-time 278 authorization engine is designed for health plans to automatically adjudicate all medical authorization requests using the EDI 278-275 standard. It auto processes all PA requests and provides real-time responses following the mandated criteria for those submissions. IIC’s solution is unique based on its compliance with the EDI 278-275 standard, mandated under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and makes 278 transactions useful, not just compliant. It helps payers reduce authorization response times and transactions costs by an order of magnitude.
            </p>

                <div class="col-md p-5">
                    <p class="lead">
                        IIC’s 278 authorization engine handles all appropriate member data, including all subscriber files, member benefits, provider contracts, and payer policies. IIC automates all the clinical guidelines the payer uses to approve, pend, or deny PA requests and allows utilization management to scale and expand based on automating the UM process. Payers are able to respond in real-time to the vast majority of prior authorization requests without human intervention, by auto adjudicating requests using EDI 278, based on the payer’s payment policies and clinical guidelines. IIC’s authorization engine is configurable to meet all the health plans authorization criteria.

                IIC’s 278 authorization engine is the first commercially available auto authorization solution for medicine based on the EDI 278-275 standard. When adjudicated correctly the first time, prior authorization prevents post-service denials, re-adjudication of claims, impacts reprocessing rates, eliminates medical review, and avoids recalculation of member liability. And it assures patients receive the most medically appropriate care based on enforcement of evidence-based medicine.

                    <li>The current prior authorization process is manual, proprietary, administratively burdensome, and very costly per transaction</li>
                    <li>Adjudication costs per transaction are very expensive, requiring back office staff for processing, clinical staff to handle denials and appeals, and FTE’s to handle incoming call center volumes</li>
                    <li>Current PA process is not scalable. Payers mainly outsource adjudication of highest cost procedures to specialty benefits companies, which adds ever more cost per transaction</li>
