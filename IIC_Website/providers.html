            <p class="lead">
                IIC’s ‘Digital Physician Assistant’ web portal (or integrated web service) offers provider organizations a single point of entry (single sign on) to check patient eligibility and benefits (EDI 270), and send referrals and prior authorizations (PA) via EDI 278 to all payers within the provider’s network. IIC’s software agnostic all-in-one solution fully complies with the EDI 278 real-time standard for PA. IIC’s value proposition is focused exclusively on the elimination of clerical work to manually complete and fax forms, or require follow up phone calls. Submitting PAs and sending electronic documents offers the same user workflow experience for all PA payer requests. Prior to submission, all PAs are reconciled against payer-specific policy guidelines to ensure compliance and reduce the possibility of denials.

                Outpatient procedures, inpatient admits, stay extensions, DME, tests, labs, drugs, etc. are approved or denied based on the payer policy guidelines (medical necessity and/or appropriate use criteria).
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                <span class="fw-bold">Problem:</span> Each payer (thousands) has their own policy guidelines per procedure (thousands) which can change every 45-60 days. The lack of automation and real-time responses causes delays in approvals, higher rates of denials, requires administrative and clinical staff (FTE’s), and delays patient treatment and outcomes. Requests are based on proprietary and non-standard workflows, which differ payer to payer. Providers know from first-hand experience the pain and frustration of 30-60 minute wait times on hold when calling the payer’s call center for questions or follow up PA status.
